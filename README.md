# Metatech University. NodeJS 2022-2023 System layer on pure Node.js
Part of educational project in [Metatech University](https://github.com/metatech-university/)'s NodeJS 2022-23 course. This repository contains code of the system layer built using pure Node.js functionality. It can launch application layer from different repository (e.g. it's sibling folder) based on configuration.

The code is considered as the next step of progressive development of the project `d-tasks2-messenger` from [metatech-university-NodeJS2022-homework](https://github.com/KLarpen/metatech-university-NodeJS2022-homework/tree/main/JavaScript/d-tasks2-messenger) repository. Specifically as result of splitting layers into separate repositories: system and application itself. The logic behind the splitting decision is to provide ability to use the same system layer as a runner for different domain applications (i.e. application server).
